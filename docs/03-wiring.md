# Wire Connections

The ESC needs to be connected to the motor using the bullet connectors. The order of the wires matters only for direction, so it is important that the following color-connection is followed:

* Left ESC plugs into channel 1 and requires any two motor-esc wires to *not* match color
* Right ESC plugs into channel 2 and requires motor-esc wires to match color

## PWM Input
The pwm uses a pair of wires, one data wire and one ground. They are connected as follows:
