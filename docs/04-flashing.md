# Flashing the ESC

In case of replacements or updates to the firmware, the speed controllers need to be flashed with custom firmware to work. The flashing process can be rather tedious if a step is forgotten, so make sure to follow the steps below in the correct order:

### Step 1
Unplug the PWM input wires from the PCA Board, they should be connected in channels 1&2 and loosen the terminals that hold the power wires in the back.

### Step 2
Before we remove the top plate, we must unscrew the screws that hold it in place (11 in total). One in the back and 10 on the bottom side.

### Step 3
Next, we remove the top plate while pulling the wires through the slit that they are coming out of. Yes, this could've been designed better, the wires should be pulled carefully.

### Step 4
With the top plate removed, the ESCs can be accessed via USB cable

## Closing it back up
Simply follow the steps in reverse, however don't forget to insert the Cover ([Part Number 11](https://ase.vu.nl/docs/framework/hardware/Components/printed-components)) and the Battery Holder ([Part Number 10](https://ase.vu.nl/docs/framework/hardware/Components/printed-components)) before closing up the top and bottom plates.
